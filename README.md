# 0xB2 - splinky
Pro-Micro/Elite-C replacement with USB-C and RP2040.

Designed for use in custom mechanical (split) keyboards, but many other uses are possible.

![Splinky v2](pcb/doc/splinky_v1_photo.jpg?raw=true "Splinvy v1")

## Features:

 * Pro-micro / Sparkfun RP2040 compatible footprint, with 5 extra pins at bottom (Elite-C style)
 * Raspberry Pi RP2040 MCU
 * Up to 16MB flash memory _(depending on component selection and availability)_
 * User LED & USB VBUS detect
 * Low profile USB-C mid-mount connector
 * Designed to be manufactured and assembled by all common PCBA services (including JLCPCB)

## Pinout

The pinout is compatible with the widely available [SparkFun RP2040](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/18288), with extra GPIO12..16 pins broken out on the lower side.

USB VBUS detection on GPIO19.

> This pinout is a _de facto_ standard, established by actors of the MK community (see discussions in `#RP2040` on the bastardkb Discord server) 

Additionnaly, a user LED is tied to GPIO17, can be used for UF2 bootloader status indication, or any other purpose (or turned OFF, no annoying always-on power LED).

## Programming

The splinky uses a basic two-button reset circuitry.

In order to put the board in bootloader mode, press briefly the RESET button (marked **R**) while holding the BOOT button (the second one).
If the buttons are not reachable (soldered upside down), the /RST pad can be shorted to GND, while the two smaller BOOT pads (next to D8) are maintained shorted (v2 only).

## Manufacturing

Releases contain required information (gerbers, bom, pos) for assembly by JLCPCB.

## Releases

 * **v3** updated pinout - current release
 * **v2** first public release
 * **v1** first prototyping run
